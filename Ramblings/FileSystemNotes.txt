Responsibilities within FileSystem on GemStone (as is):

FileSystem 

delegates to a FileSystemStore (a DiskStore or a MemoryStore)

DiskStore class defaultWorkingDirectory references GsFile to find the working directory. 

So is DiskStore not portable? Maybe it should not be. Hmm?

Where is GsFile referenced within the FileSystemGs world?

from File, this is appropriate. I'm definitely replacing File in its entirety, and replacing FileHandle with  FileDescriptor

From DiskStore class for defaultWorkingDirectory (not a clean location for this)
and DiskStore instance for iterating over contents of a directory (#basicEntry:path:nodesDo:)

It would be nice to think that DiskStore could be platform-independent.

It feels like those two things in DiskStore and DiskStore class could use some other class. 

So the main class is FileDescriptor. It mainly deals with open file descriptors.

Another class should deal with generic operations. Is this a subclass of UnixStore, 
specific to GemStone?
No, not right now, at least, I think.

Operations provided:




---------------------

Directories deserve to be their own objects, at the low level. 

---------------------

Then there's the buffered streams -- how do those work?

GsExternalReadStream has a reference to a CByteArray buffer, and a reference to a FileDescriptor

FileDescriptor creates the stream (holds it as unique?) and holds instances of one or
 more LibcWrapper subclasses. Handles EINTR and so on as appropriate.

Libc*  The wrappers are pretty small, so can have multiples. Each wraps an instance
of an FFI class.

Instances of the FFI classes themselves are also pretty small.

---

Unbuffered reads will be less common.



----

FileDescriptors should close themselves on GC.
This means an ephemeron registry. On the class side of FileDescriptor? Yes, let's.

----

FileSystemError vs. FileException -- what to do?

FileException has subclasses
  CannotDeleteFileException
  FileAlreadyExistsException
  FileDoesNotExistException
  FileWriteError

FileSystemError has subclasses 
  DirectoryDoesNotExist
  DirectoryExists
  DirectoryIsNotEmpty
  FileExists
  IllegalName

So quite a bit of overlap.

There's also ResolutionRequest, a Notification subclass.

=============================

Tests failing:

FileSystem-Tests-Disk > DiskFileSystemTest >> testFileNames -- legit failure, looks like. Fix later. Fails to get directory 
entry path as UTF-8 string, so the directory entry does not exist. 
Not the best way of getting this functionality in any case

FileHandleTest>>testTruncate Truncate NYI

FileReferenceTest >> testUpToAll  ZnUTF8Encoder>>nextCodePointFromStream not currently supported.
Which probably means UTF-8 is mostly unsupported.

---------------

OK, let's see what still works if we gut the obsolete classes.

First, File. Copied it and removed all methods from the original.

BreadthFirstGuideTest is passing -- why? Because it tests with a memory file system.
Will likely be true of all the guide tests.
And:
All of the SingleTreeTests
CopyVisitorTest

Most of FileLocatorTest passes (all but testMoveTo). Probably legit.

FileReferenceTest is mixed.

PathTest passes in its entirety. May be OK.

DiskFileSystemTest fails entirely, which is excellent!

===============================

I want to replace FileHandle with FileDescriptor
In order for memory filesystem to keep working, do I need to replace MemoryHandle with
MemoryFileDescriptor or something?

What does MemoryHandle do?

A MemoryHandle instance has "primitives" to do I/O on a MemoryFileSystemEntry, 
which it holds in an instvar. 
So it does hold a similar place in the design as a FileDescriptor, so maybe making it into
a MemoryFileDescriptor makes sense.

There are operations supported by FileSystemHandle (both FileHandle and MemoryHandle) that I 
don't think we want to support. These include things like #at:. In normal FileSystem operation, 

=================================

To implement binaryReadStream...

FileReference >> binaryReadStream 
Filesystem >> binaryReadStreamOn: aPath
  Filesystem >> open:withOptions: "On success, yields a FileDescriptor"
  

=================================

To Do:

Need to write tests for getting and setting current working directory. 
(will need to have ability to create and change directories first...)
* Longer than 4K bytes 
* Containing non-ASCII characters

Need to test that a transient ephemeron will fire when it's the only thing holding a persistent object in memory. Until #48585  F3  Class option #noAggressiveStubbing is done, may need to set aggressiveStubbing off in the test gem.

Need to add #noStubbing (or #noAggressiveStubbing) to RegistryEphemeron once feature request 48585 is done.

========================

Things I'm identified to remove once they're suitably replaced, but have not yet removed:
